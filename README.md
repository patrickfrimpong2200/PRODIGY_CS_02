# PRODIGY_CS_02
A straightforward image encryption tool utilizing pixel manipulation. It enables users to perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations on each pixel. The tool allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt images.
Simple Image Encryption Tool
This project is a simple image encryption tool developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The tool uses pixel manipulation techniques, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images using basic operations like swapping pixel values or applying mathematical operations to each pixel. It serves as an introduction to cryptography and image processing.

Features:
Encrypt Images: Apply basic encryption by manipulating pixel values.

Decrypt Images: Reverse the encryption using the same key.

Pixel Manipulation: Swap pixel values or apply mathematical operations like addition or subtraction to each pixel.

Simple Command-Line Interface: Encrypt and decrypt images easily via terminal commands.

Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language.

NumPy: For handling arrays and mathematical operations.

Pillow (PIL): To process and manipulate image files.
